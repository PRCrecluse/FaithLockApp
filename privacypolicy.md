Effective Date: 17th April 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how FaithLock ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our iOS application.

By using FaithLock, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

1. Data We Collect
We do not collect or store personal data like your name, email address, or IP address. However, certain information is collected automatically to improve the app's functionality and performance. This includes:

Crash logs (via Apple's diagnostics tools)
App usage data (via Apple, Superwall, and PostHog)
Device information (such as device model, iOS version, and language settings)
We also collect:

Religious preference (Christian-based prayer content)
Age group, as required for app personalization and experience
2. How We Use Your Data
We use this information to:

Monitor app performance
Diagnose bugs or crashes
Understand general user behavior (e.g., time spent in app, screen views)
Improve subscription experiences through Superwall
All analytics data is anonymized and is never used for advertising or sold to third parties.

3. Third-Party Services
We rely on the following third-party tools to operate the app:

Apple App Store & Analytics – for purchases and usage insights
Superwall – to manage subscriptions and present paywalls
PostHog (Cloud) – for product analytics and feature usage
Gemini API (Google) – to generate AI-based prayers
These providers may collect anonymized data according to their own privacy practices. No personally identifiable information is intentionally transmitted.

4. AI-Generated Content
FaithLock uses artificial intelligence to generate personalized prayers. These are created automatically based on your interaction with the app and are intended for devotional use only. No input is permanently stored or shared.

5. Your Privacy Controls
Since no user accounts are created, there is no user profile to delete. However, if you wish to request the deletion of analytics data associated with your device, contact us at:

prcrecluse@gmail.com

We will process your request and delete any identifiable analytics data stored via PostHog.

6. Children's Privacy
This app is rated 4+ on the App Store. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware of unintentional data collection from a child, we will delete it promptly.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes go into effect constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
